# SALTISE Conference: "A hands-on educational kit showcasing ethical and responsible use of AI to solve a societal issue"

I might be a bit late with this post, but better late than never, right?

I cannot overstate the awe I feel being surrounded by incredibly talented teachers in my CS program. This past summer, a notable highlight was witnessing two of my teachers, in collaboration with a professor from Concordia University, unveil their research project at the [SALTISE](https://sites.events.concordia.ca/sites/saltise/en/saltise2023/pages/25085) conference — a gathering centered on fostering innovation in educational technology.

I had the privilege of joining several of my peers in supporting our teachers at the conference, stepping into the vital volunteer role of a teaching assistant. Our tasks were multifaceted; we prepared Raspberry Pi Pico kits, fine-tuned and uploaded code to guarantee optimal functionality, and assembled breadboards with all the necessary components to ensure they were ready for the conference. Beyond hardware preparation, we also configured laptops and were available to answer any questions from attendees during the interactive sessions, fostering a collaborative and engaging learning environment.

*Here is the synopsist from the SALTISE official program:*
> This activity is a practical demonstration for teachers in STEM
of how ethical and responsible AI can be used in the classroom
to tackle a societal issue. Participants will use a Raspberry PI
and sensors to read data and make AI decisions. The activity is
one of three pedagogical kits developed by a team from John
Abbott College and Concordia University with funding from
the PIA (Pôle montréalais d’enseignement supérieure en intelligence artificielle).

##  AI with Revolutionary Educational Kits
The research team presented a trio of educational AI kits, meticulously crafted to facilitate a graded learning curve for students venturing into the AI space. Every kit featured a comprehensive Teacher’s Guide, a Code Guide, and an Activity Guide.

**Kit 1**: Tailored for beginners, this kit adopts a gentle learning curve, requiring no prior programming experience. It initiates students into the world of AI, using the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) for AI training and offering a pre-built [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) environment to test the trained AI. Speaking from personal experience, I can vouch for its efficacy as a stellar starting point in one’s AI journey.

**Kit 2**: Taking a step forward, this kit delves into the mechanics of recommender systems. Leveraging a ready-made Sephora database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it offers a rich, hands-on experience that uncovers the intricacies of crafting a recommender system.

**Kit 3**: While I am yet to explore this kit fully, its focus lies on developing an activity tracker to monitor room occupancy — a testament to its real-world application potential. I look forward to delving into it upon its completion.

## Hands-On Learning
The reception was heartwarming, with participants visibly enjoying the interactive model training sessions, asking meaningful questions, and engaging in debate. The hands-on exercises not only illustrated the power of AI but also opened a gateway to a world of playful, engaged learning.

As the conference progressed, I found myself swelling with pride and gratitude, not just for being part of a transformative educational experience, but also for the later opportunity to contribute to a research project that stands at the confluence of technology and education, a beacon guiding us towards a future brimming with possibilities as AI technology grows in presence.

## An opportunity

Later in the summer, I received the extraordinary opportunity to contribute directly to this groundbreaking research project. Being able to immerse myself and play a part in this frontier of educational technology was both enlightening and fulfilling. I had a hand in various aspects of the project, from brainstorming sessions where we discussed the potential improvements to the AI kits to hands-on work, writing the code guide, creating infographics, and preparing the project's GitBook page. This experience not only allowed me to deepen my understanding of AI technology but also provided a rare glimpse into the collaborative, dynamic, and innovative world of educational research. It was a privilege to contribute my perspective and efforts to a project of this magnitude, and it has fostered in me a deeper appreciation for the complexity and potential that lies in the intersection of AI technology and education.

## Looking Ahead

As I reflect on this enriching journey, I am filled with hope and excitement for what lies ahead in the educational landscape, a path that we are carving with passion, innovation, and a deep-seated desire to foster learning through the dynamic realm of AI technology.

## The project

In the near future, a comprehensive GitBook page will be made available to the public, encompassing all the essential resources crafted throughout this project. This repository will house everything from links to Code Guides and Activity Guides pertinent to all three kits.

I harbor the hopeful aspiration that educators far and wide will seize this golden opportunity to bring the wonders of AI closer to young minds and any individuals with a burgeoning interest in this field. It is my belief that by equipping teachers with the right tools and resources, a spark of curiosity and wonder can be ignited in more learners, opening up a realm of limitless possibilities and fostering a new generation of tech-savvy individuals who are well-versed in AI technologies.
